            <section class="space-y-6">
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I created this website because I found it difficult to
                    locate a reliable tool to check who doesn't follow you back.
                    Most websites I came across either asked for your username
                    and password (which I’m not comfortable sharing with random
                    sites) or required payment. Some even used scrapers, which
                    violate Instagram's Terms of Service, or demanded access to
                    all your information and sent it to external servers.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    My website is different: it only requires two files—your
                    followers and following lists, which you can review
                    yourself. Nothing sensitive is involved, and no data is sent
                    to any server. All computations are done locally on your
                    device, so you could even use the site in airplane mode.
